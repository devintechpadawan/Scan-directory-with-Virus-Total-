# Scan-directory-with-Virus-Total-

This script will take any directory you point it to, walk the path, hash all of the files, display them in a PrettyTable, run them through Virus Total and display output from each security provider. You must get a Virus Total API key and add it to line 14. You can only scan 4 documents per minute with the free API key.
